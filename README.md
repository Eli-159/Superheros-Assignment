This is a relatively simple project that provides access to the Superhero API. To run locally, close the repository and then run the following:
```
npm install
npm run build-database
npm start
```

If viewing code, I suggest checking out [req-que.js](main/models/req-que.js) to see the request que class used to handle API requests made by the server.

Please note: the included .env file requires updating. To access the Superhero API you will require an access token from https://superheroapi.com/.
